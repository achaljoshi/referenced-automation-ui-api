# One-shot setup: installs this repo's dependencies. Also installs the browser binaries Playwright needs (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) plus their OS-level dependencies.
#
# Packages - the @automation/* ones too - are installed BY VERSION from the npm registry in NPM_REGISTRY_URL: the
# versions are the ones in package.json. To pick up a newer version of a package, change its version there and run
# `npm install` (README: Upgrading a package).
#
# Without these packages in a registry yet - or to try a change you have not published - use local mode:
#   ./scripts/setup.sh --local
# It builds the sibling repos this one depends on (referenced-automation-utils, referenced-automation-api, referenced-automation-ui, referenced-automation-sap), keeps their .tgz files in
# ../shared-packages and installs those instead. Nothing in package.json or package-lock.json changes. The sibling
# repos must be checked out next to this one. (USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=1 does the same.)

# Usage: ./scripts/setup.sh [--local]
