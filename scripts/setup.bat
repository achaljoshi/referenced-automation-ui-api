REM ============================================================================
REM One-shot local setup - works from a completely fresh clone of the whole
REM repo family, in any order: builds whichever sibling packages this repo
REM depends on (from a sibling checkout, cloning nothing on its own) before
REM `npm ci`, since npm ci fails otherwise if e.g. referenced-automation-utils
REM hasn't been packaged into ..\shared-packages yet. Also installs the
REM browser binaries Playwright needs (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) plus their
REM OS-level deps - nothing to install manually, no system browser required.
