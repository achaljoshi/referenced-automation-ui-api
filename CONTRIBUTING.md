# Contributing to referenced-automation-ui-api

The shared rules (tests with negative controls, no hard waits, no secrets, ADRs, review checklist, deprecation policy) are in
[`referenced-automation-utils/docs/governance/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../referenced-automation-utils/docs/governance/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Release and upgrade steps: [`RELEASING.md`](../referenced-automation-utils/docs/governance/RELEASING.md). Decisions: [`docs/adr`](../referenced-automation-utils/docs/adr/README.md).

## Before you push
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run security
```
`npm test` runs `bddgen` first (it generates the Gherkin tests into `.features-gen/`).

Update `CHANGELOG.md`. This repo is in the chain `utils` -> `api`/`ui` -> `sap` -> `ui-api`: nothing depends on this repo.
